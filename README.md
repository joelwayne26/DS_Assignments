# DS_Assignments

## 1) <br/>  <br/>

These are assignments of data structures and algotithms.

Assignment1:Write a C program that calculates the average of marks got by a student in three subjects ie Physics, Chemistry, Math...assume for each subject, four different tests were conducted; assignment, Course work, mid term and end of term exams

## 2) <br/>  <br/>
   **An algorithm that `swaps two numbers`.**  <br/>
   step 1: Enter the first number and store it in a variable named a. <br/>
   step 2: Enter the second number and store it in a variable named b. <br/>
   step 3: Declare a temprary variable c. <br/>
   step 4: Equate c to a ie c=a, then equate a to b ie a=b then equate d to c ie d = c. <br/>

   **Pseudo code to swap two numbers.**  <br/> <br/>
   
   START <br/>
        // declare variables a,b and c. <br/>
       DECLARE a, d ,c  <br/>
       PRINT "Enter value for a:"  <br/>
       INPUT a <br/>
       PRINT "Enter value for b:" <br/>
       INPUT b <br/>
       PRINT "Before swapping: a= , b= ",a,b <br/>
         //swapiing the two numbers <br/>
       c=a <br/>
       a=b <br/>
       b=c <br/>
       //printing results <br/>
       PRINT "After swapping:a= ,b= ",a,b <br/>
       
   END <br/>  <br/>
